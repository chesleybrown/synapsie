=======================
Django Session Messages
=======================

An anonymous session messages application for Django projects, intended to
fill the gap until the patch in ticket 4604 lands in Django trunk.


Installation
============

Get the Subversion trunk version of the application::

    svn checkout http://django-session-messages.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django_session_messages

To install django-session-messages:

    1. Put the ``session_messages`` folder somewhere on your Python path.
    2. Put ``'session_messages'`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
    3. Put ``'session_messages.context_processors.session_messages'`` in
    your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting.

The third step will make a ``session_messages`` variable available in all of
your templates, containing any messages that have been set for the current
session.

Creating messages
=================

To create a message for the current session, import the ``create_message``
function from the ``session_messages`` module, and call it with the request
and a string argument::

    create_message(request, 'Your comment has been saved.')

Displaying messages
===================

The ``session_messages`` variable placed in your template context by the
context processor is just a list of message strings.  You can easily loop
through them and display them like so::

    <ul class="messages">
    {% for message in session_messages %}
      <li>{{ message }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

Deleting messages
=================

Messages are transient - they are automatically deleted from the session
when fetched for display in a template, so you don't need to delete them
manually.

If no template ever accesses the session_messages variable, messages will
not be deleted.
